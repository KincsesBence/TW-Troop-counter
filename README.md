# TW Troop counter
[Inno games cdn source](https://media.innogamescdn.com/com_DS_HU/scripts/sereg_szamlalo.js)

Tribalwars ingame script for counting troops. The script is capable of counting several pages of village units. You can also select the groups and the current position of the teams, e.g.: available, on the way, under reinforcements.

If you have successfully selected what you want to count, you can copy the result to the clipboard with one click so that you can forward it to anyone.
